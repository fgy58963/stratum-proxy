Stratum Proxy
===========

Stratum Proxy is a tool to add caching for certain functions for electrum clients.

`go build` to build the program

`stratum-proxy -host=server:port` to run the program

The proxy will listen locally on port 8080


TODO
----

Need to add config options

Need to test multiple clients at once
